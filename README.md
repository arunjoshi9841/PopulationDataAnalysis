# PopulationDataAnalysis

Using the World Bank Data, analyzed the interrelationships among at four indicators to see which economic and/or social indicators are related.
## How a country’s life expectancy is affected by number of people affected by HIV and the availability of sanitation services
From year 2000 to 2009 the minimum life expectancy among all the countries is 49.87 and the maximum is 74.69 Also, from the above data we can see that there exists a country or a region where only 4.057 percent of the population is using safely managed sanitation services. On examination I found the country to be Niger and surprisingly its life expectancy was also the lowest i.e. 48.875.
Although I expected Sanitation and life expectancy to be very closely correlated, the data presented somewhat skewed outcome. Number of people with HIV has almost the same effect on life expectancy as sanitation does.

## How a country’s population growth rate is affected by Unemployment rate and availability of electricity
From the data summary we can observe that the median of people with access to electricity is 96.74 percent which I thought was pretty impressive. 
 I looked to see what were the countries with minimum availability of electricity after 1999 and found out that these were war torn countries like Afghanistan and Sudan with very low life expectancy. The above correlation depicts that electricity access is somewhat related to population growth even more than unemployment.
## If Refugee population by country or territory of asylum affects the Intentional homicides.
Homicide and number of refugees are not related. In fact the correlation is -0.08

## relation between Maternity leave and GDP
On research I found out the country with the highest Paid maternity leave of 630 was San Marino. According to San Marino’s governmental website,  100% of the insured's earnings is paid for five months (two months before and three months after the expected date of childbirth); thereafter, mothers can remain on leave and receive a benefit of 30% of earnings for one year and 20% for an additional six months, or they can return to work and take up to two hours of leave a day with full pay until the child is age 1. 

Also, Maternal Leave and GDP are not very related. Despite variation in GDP, Most countries have similar Maternity paid leave of around 90 days.
